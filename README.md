# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

This is literally just whatever I add/change to Folke's starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

If you don't want to roll your own Neovim, or you want something more complete than Kickstart LazyVim is probably the best place to start.
